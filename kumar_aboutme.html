                        <p>
                            Hello my name is Divam. I am a programmer, musician, and video producer. I can use Google Docs,  Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, 
                Ableton Live (for music production along with famous vsts such as Xfer Records Serum), and Blender for basic 3d modeling. I hope to be 
                all of these things when I am an adult. 
                How I plan to achieve these things is to go to computer science for college, and do video editing and music producing on the side.
                I plan to be a computer science major because the world of today relies heavily on the tasks of computers. I do music production and
                music produciton on the side, and I plant to start them as separate services that I will run along my main job of computer science. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Aside from my technical skills, I possess soft skills as well such as teamwork, persistence, leadership, honesty, versatility, dilligence, and proactiveness. 
                I learned these skills through my experiences in high school through doing sports and working through difficult classes. Hard work and teamwork
                were qualitites that I earned through years of playing soccer, basketball, and running cross country and track and field. I also learned that 
                teamwork is the way that people accomplish their goals, as I had to work together with my classmates to push through the rigorous classes that 
                I took in my high school career. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Through my soft skills and technical skills I have made many important achievements through my life. I am president of the music production club
                at school, and the secretary of the noodle club at school, in which I market the club through creating songs and videos for the club. I have had 
                volunteer experience at Dublin Relay for Life May 2015, where I sold food at the event for about 12 hours I was able to use my advertising skills 
                to raise awareness and money for charity,I rose awareness for cancer and I ran laps around the track to contribute to charity. Additional volunteer
                service was at the Dublin Library where I enocuraged children to read and play board games instead of playing video games or using smartphones.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall the many achievements that I have had through life are from the technical and soft skills that I acuired over time.
