                    <p> The goal of the project was to create a fully-functioning project in MIT's Scratch Software. 
                    The project could either be a movie or a game. My partner and I make a scary maze with many jumpscares.
                    The project required programming skills as well as soft skills such as teamwork and time management. 
                    I had to code and document most of the project. Important concepts I learned from this activity was variables.

                    <p> The goal of the project was to create a functioning app in MIT's AppInventor Software. 
                    My partner and I decided to create a project which allowed users to draw a picture in fifteen seconds
                    of a random object generated by our application. Unfortunately we did not have the skills to have the 
                    program judge whethe the drawing was drawed correctly, however, we managed to do the rest of it. 
                    The project required programming skills as well as soft skills such as teamwork and time management. 
                    I learned how to deal with responsive coding. I had to fix many bugs in the program.
