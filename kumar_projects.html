                    <p> The goal of the project was to create a fully-functioning project in MIT's Scratch Software. 
                    The project could either be a movie or a game. My partner and I make a scary maze with many jumpscares.
                    The project required programming skills as well as soft skills such as teamwork and time management. 
                    I had to code and document most of the project. Important concepts I learned from this activity was variables.

                    <p> The goal of the project was to create a functioning app in MIT's AppInventor Software. 
                    My partner and I decided to create a project which allowed users to draw a picture in fifteen seconds
                    of a random object generated by our application. Unfortunately we did not have the skills to have the 
                    program judge whethe the drawing was drawed correctly, however, we managed to do the rest of it. 
                    The project required programming skills as well as soft skills such as teamwork and time management. 
                    I learned how to deal with responsive coding. I had to fix many bugs in the program.

                    <p> The goal of the project was to create a functioning, 
                    and useful app in Google's Andriod Studio software. 
                    My partner and I decided to create an app to help biologists. 
                    
                    Here is our problem statement:
                    
                    Environmental scientists in the field regularly use paper to store their data. This is problematic due to the way in which environmental scientists are regularly exposed to harsh environments and could cause their handwritten data spreadsheets to be destroyed. To solve this problem, we are developing an app that allows for the scientist to log into their account and use their voice to dictate data into a spreadsheet that ends up backing up their data into an online database. If any information needs to be edited, it can. his is possible by using CMU Sphinx which letâ€™s the user just use a keyword to start dictation and collect data just by using voice. It will store it in a simple table and can be exported as a excel file. We also have access to other users who input previous data in databases. You can also create your own database if needed. Databases would be stored in the Backendless. 
                    The project required programming skills, such as Java, which is necessary for the functionality of the app, as well as soft skills such as teamwork and time management. 
                    
                    There was difficulty in learning to use the Andrio Studio app, but together my partner and I managed to work through the difficulty.

                    <p> 
                    This is the project me and my partner used to satisfy the Entreprenuership Challenge.
                    The goal of the Entreprenuership Challenge is to create a product that solves a real problem.
                    My partner and I decided to create Time To Bounce as an app that predicts the possiblilty of someone
                    finding an open baskteball court depending on the time of the day and what day it is based on trends
                    and real-time feedback. My partner and I were able to develop a prototype of the app. 
                    The project required programming skills such as Java, and CSS to style the project. There was also artistic skills 
                    necessary to make the app look aesthetic. Soft skills such as teamwork and time management are also 
                    needed to get the app completed in time. 
                    Through this project, I learned debugging really well, since that was the main difficulty with our project.
